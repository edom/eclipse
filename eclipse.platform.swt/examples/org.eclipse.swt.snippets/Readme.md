Setting the classpath:
----------------------

To compile this project, you need to set the classpath specific for your operating and windowing system.
For this, rename one of the following files to `.classpath`:

* .classpath_win32 - Windows
* .classpath_cocoa - Mac OS X
* .classpath_gtk - Linux and all Unix variants

To see these files, you may have to remove the filter for ".* resources":
* In the Project Explorer: view menu > Customize View... > Filters
* In the Package Explorer: view menu > Filters...
